# Online store BE


By Vladyslav Petlovyi


This is the backend part of my online store Angular project. Here, I have used Hapi, an open-source Node. js framework used to build powerful and scalable web applications. Hapi is commonly used to build Application Programming Interface servers, HTTP-proxy applications, and websites.

It is just pure JS and I managed to organize it like a Java-based BE project. I have used also MySQL for a database.

I have also added possibility to connect Firebase to BE but since Firebase haven't yet added support for Angular 16, I will do that later, as soon as it will be possible.
